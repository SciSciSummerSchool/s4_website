  title: "Quantifying hierarchy and dynamics in U.S. faculty hiring and retention"
  description: "Faculty hiring and retention determine the composition of the U.S. academic workforce and directly shape educational outcomes, careers, the development and spread of ideas, and research priorities. But hiring and retention are dynamic, reflecting societal and academic priorities, generational turnover, and efforts to diversify the professoriate along gender, racial, and socioeconomic lines. Understanding these processes requires that we import diverse methods and concepts, including social hierarchies, network science, epidemiology, and demography. In this talk, we'll analyze the academic employment and doctoral education of tenure-track faculty at all PhD-granting U.S. universities over the decade 2011-2020, quantifying stark inequalities in faculty production, prestige, retention, and gender. In the process, we'll introduce numerous methods and concepts, with the goal of connecting the analysis of faculty hiring and retention with methodologies and frameworks that are broadly useful across the science of science."

  title: "Publishing actionable and open science of science"
  description: "Every step of science-making leaves behind a digital trace of scientists’ own behaviour. Armed with new computational tools, scientists of science scour these data for signals that will help them make the scientific enterprise more efficient and more equitable. The field is no longer a niche of specialist interest, but a stream of research with clearly defined use cases in science making, funding, and science policy, complementing other metasciences. But to live up to its promise and truly make a difference, the field must become more actionable. It should not just tell us how the world of science currently is, it should also push us towards the science that could be. This applies to all stages of research, from what kinds of questions researchers ask (causal or correlational) to how they communicate their results to the public and policymakers. Being more actionable also means diversifying data sources, and publishing reproducible science. In this session, I will cover key steps in actionable science-making and its effective communication."

  title: "Little in academia makes sense except in the light of prestige"
  description: "Although meritocracy is a key organizing principle of academia, the degree to which individual and institutional differences in scholarly outputs reflect meritocratic differences is both contentious and poorly understood. In this talk, I argue that in the science of science, institutional prestige is a first-order variable, shaping nearly all aspects of what science gets done, who does it, and who gets to be scientists. In short, little in academia makes sense except in the light of prestige. I'll support this argument with evidence from three directions: (1) how prestige structures faculty hiring networks, of who hires whose graduates as faculty, (2) how institutional prestige shapes the productivity of its faculty, and (3) how prestige shapes the spread of scientific ideas. These findings suggest that the social mechanisms the drive scientific innovation are fundamentally grounded in the prestige economy of the scientific community, and efforts to develop a science of science must account for its effects in order to understand knowledge production."

  title: "Quantifying the biases of scientific impact"
  description: "Every day our life is made easier by efficient measures and algorithms that search and rank scientific information. Yet, these measures and algorithms have an issue: they are trained on citations, which are ingrained with human biases. Therefore the output is inherently biased too, creating inequalities, raising concerns of discrimination, even harming economic growth. In this talk, I will present research focusing on quantifying various biases in publication data. The overarching goal of this research is to uncover the bias mechanisms that, given the same quality, drive different citation trajectories, and use them (1) to create fair measures and algorithms, (2) to improve our understanding of the scientific enterprise."

  title: "Dynamics of cross-platform attention to retracted papers"
  description: "Scientific retraction has been on the rise recently. Retracted papers are frequently discussed online, enabling the broad dissemination of potentially flawed findings. Our analysis spans a nearly 10-y period and reveals that most papers exhaust their attention by the time they get retracted, meaning that retractions cannot curb the online spread of problematic papers. This is striking as we also find that retracted papers are pervasive across mediums, receiving more attention after publication than nonretracted papers even on curated platforms, such as news outlets and knowledge repositories. Interestingly, discussions on social media express more criticism toward subsequently retracted results and may thus contain early signals related to unreliable work."

  title: "Improving scientific publishing – Leading by example!"
  description: "The study of scientific publishing practices is a prominent topic in science of science. There is a rich body of work studying the journal publishing system, the organization of peer review, the use of impact factors and other citation metrics, the adoption of open access publishing and other open science practices, challenges around research integrity, the complex role of commercial publishers, and so on. The science of science community has a deep knowledge of many of the intricate issues related to scientific publishing. I will review some of this knowledge in my lecture. In addition, I will make a call for more reflection on our own publishing practices as science of science researchers: How do we, as members of the science of science community, disseminate our own research, and to what extent do we use our knowledge of the scientific publishing system to actively contribute to improving the system? I will argue that we need to do better: The science of science community has a responsibility to lead by example."

  title: "Natural language understanding of causal claims and exaggerations in science publications and news"
  description: "Establishing causality is one of the most important goals in scientific research. Researchers also tend to explain the implications and give practical advice based on causal findings. Therefore, the language that describes causal claims and their implications plays a crucial role in communicating research results among scientists and with the general public. However, scientists and journalists have been found to inappropriately use causal language in research publications and news articles, such as extrapolating correlational findings, often from observational studies, for causal claims and practical advice. In the past few years, our research group has developed a suite of NLP models for predicting the presence and strength levels of claims and advice given in research conclusions. Applying these models to PubMed articles, we studied characteristics of causal language use and advice giving in observational studies. We further developed a tool to link research papers with press releases, with which we were able to compare corresponding claims and detect potential exaggerations. Our work contributes to illustrating current status and longitudinal patterns of causal language use and advice giving in science literature. The computational tools can also help detect potential exaggerations in science communication."

Yet data are often not discoverable by the communities that need to access and use them.  This presentation provides a set of innovative new technologies to democratize the search for and discovery of data.  It provides new ways to (i) discover how scientific data are used from a broad cross-section of primary, secondary and even tertiary sources, (ii) validate the information with key stakeholders, and (iii) communicate the value of data. https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/g6e8noiy/release/2"

  title: "Augmenting Scientific Discovery By Harnessing Scientific Literature"
  description: "With over one million papers added every year to the PubMed biomedical index alone — the explosion of scholarly knowledge presents tremendous opportunities for accelerating research across the sciences. However, while scientific knowledge is expanding with rapidity, our human minds have limited capacity for finding, assimilating and manipulating information. In this talk, I will present our recent work toward helping researchers and practitioners make use of this vast treasure trove of information. I will highlight computational methods in artificial intelligence and natural language processing that mine literature and knowledge bases to help discover new directions and solutions to problems, generate hypotheses, make predictions and decisions, and build connections across different ideas and areas. This includes a method that predicts clinical outcomes of hospital patients by mining the literature for patient-specific medical literature, NLP-powered models for predicting off-label drug uses, and novel exploratory search and recommendation engines: for discovering drug combination therapies, causal relationships, challenges and directions in COVID-19 research, and authors who inspire novel directions and collaboration opportunities in the computer science community."

  title: "The negative biases of author-suggested reviewers on the outcome of peer review"
  description: "Peer review is an important part of science, aimed at providing expert and objective assessment of a manuscript. Because of many factors, including time constraints, unique expertise needs, and deference, many journals ask authors to suggest peer reviewers for their own manuscript. Previous researchers have found differing effects about this practice that might be inconclusive due to sample sizes. In this article, we analyze the association between author-suggested reviewers and review invitation, review scores, acceptance rates, and subjective review quality using a large dataset of close to 8K manuscripts from 46K authors and 21K reviewers from the journal PLOS ONE's Neuroscience section. We found that all-author-suggested review panels increase the chances of acceptance by 20 percent points vs all-editor-suggested panels while agreeing to review less often. While PLOS ONE has since ended the practice of asking for suggested reviewers, many others still use them and perhaps should consider the results presented here."

  title: "Causal Inference for Complex Observational Data"
  description: "The goal of most empirical studies in policy research and medical research is to determine whether an alteration in an intervention or a treatment will cause a change in the desired outcome response. Unlike randomized designs, establishing the causal relationship based on observational studies is a challenging problem because the ceteris paribus condition is violated. When the covariates of interest are measured with errors, evaluating the causal effects becomes a thorny issue. Additional challenge arises from confounding variables which are often of high dimensional or correlated with the error-prone covariates. Most of the existing methods for estimating the average causal effect heavily rely on parametric assumptions about the propensity score or the outcome regression model one way or the other. In reality, both models are prone to misspecification, which can have undue influence on the estimated average causal effect. To the best of our knowledge, all the existing methods cannot handle high-dimensional covariates in the presence of error-prone covariates. We propose a semiparametric method to establish the causal relationship, which yields a consistent estimator of the average causal effect. The method we proposed results in efficient estimators of the covariate effects. We investigate their theoretical properties and demonstrate their finite sample performance through extensive simulation studies."

  title: "S4 2021 presentation: 'Making the tough shot–studying successful topic switch strategies using large-scale scholarly databases' by Mengyi Sun"
  description: "Mounting evidence suggests that switching research topics can be harmful for scientific careers. Paradoxically, several studies also found that the most successful researchers have evolving research interests and that breaking away from the research topics of their Ph.D. advisors is a key step for building their own success. That the most successful scientists make the toughest move suggests they must have done something special. We plan to integrate several databases of scholarly activities, such as the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG), the “MENTORSHIP” database, and PubMed, to identify the spectrum over which individuals switch topics and explore the potential factors that differentiate those who encountered difficulty and those who ultimately achieved success. Our research has important implications for researchers’ selection of topics, especially for early-career scientists. For the whole scientific community, identifying factors that encourage individual scientists to explore more diverse topics could potentially accelerate scientific discovery."

  description: "This project builds on a preliminary study evaluating retracted COVID-19-related articles on PubMed. Forty-one retracted COVID-19 citations in the areas of medicine and technology were found on PubMed. This dataset was used to determine if a bipartite network was present, identify network connectivity among retracted authors, visually display commonly used keywords, and evaluate the papers in which these articles were cited in order to determine if there was a propagation of misinformation. In the next iteration of this project, articles listed on Retraction Watch's 'Retracted coronavirus (COVID-19) papers' will be cross-referenced with metadata from  Google Scholar to determine a discipline of publication network, a retracted paper network, and a citation network to identify the possible propagation of misinformation. Using a network approach, this research examines the inequalities in knowledge flow and the propagation of misinformation of retracted COVID-19 articles."
