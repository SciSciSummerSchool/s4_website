  title: "Practical NLP and Deep Learning for Scientific Text Mining"
  description: "Keeping up with scientific literature is like drinking from a firehose. as more papers are published each year, automated methods for discovering, reading, and understanding the literature are needed to help us identify the latest and most applicable findings. This is especially the case in biomedical literature, where novel developments may have direct and immediate ramifications to patient care. in this talk, I will provide an overview of several projects that focus on scientific document understanding. I will discuss recent work on classifying text in scientific papers by combining document visual layout and semantics, which can produce high-fidelity, machine-readable representations of scientific papers that are useful for a variety of downstream applications. I will then provide several examples of how NLP and deep learning methods can be applied to specific problems in biomedical text mining such as relation extraction, fact checking, and multi-document summarization. These problems involve interactions between many documents, and the success of our models depends on our ability to accurately retrieve and extract information from all relevant documents. I will close with a discussion of ongoing challenges in this domain, and how we are hoping to address these challenges going forward."

  title: "Publishing actionable and open science of science"
  description: "Every step of science-making leaves behind a digital trace of scientists’ own behaviour. Armed with new computational tools, scientists of science scour these data for signals that will help them make the scientific enterprise more efficient and more equitable. The field is no longer a niche of specialist interest, but a stream of research with clearly defined use cases in science making, funding, and science policy, complementing other metasciences. But to live up to its promise and truly make a difference, the field must become more actionable. It should not just tell us how the world of science currently is, it should also push us towards the science that could be. This applies to all stages of research, from what kinds of questions researchers ask (causal or correlational) to how they communicate their results to the public and policymakers. Being more actionable also means diversifying data sources, and publishing reproducible science. In this session, I will cover key steps in actionable science-making and its effective communication."

  title: "Little in academia makes sense except in the light of prestige"
  description: "Although meritocracy is a key organizing principle of academia, the degree to which individual and institutional differences in scholarly outputs reflect meritocratic differences is both contentious and poorly understood. In this talk, I argue that in the science of science, institutional prestige is a first-order variable, shaping nearly all aspects of what science gets done, who does it, and who gets to be scientists. In short, little in academia makes sense except in the light of prestige. I'll support this argument with evidence from three directions: (1) how prestige structures faculty hiring networks, of who hires whose graduates as faculty, (2) how institutional prestige shapes the productivity of its faculty, and (3) how prestige shapes the spread of scientific ideas. These findings suggest that the social mechanisms the drive scientific innovation are fundamentally grounded in the prestige economy of the scientific community, and efforts to develop a science of science must account for its effects in order to understand knowledge production."

  title: "Dynamics of cross-platform attention to retracted papers"
  description: "Scientific retraction has been on the rise recently. Retracted papers are frequently discussed online, enabling the broad dissemination of potentially flawed findings. Our analysis spans a nearly 10-y period and reveals that most papers exhaust their attention by the time they get retracted, meaning that retractions cannot curb the online spread of problematic papers. This is striking as we also find that retracted papers are pervasive across mediums, receiving more attention after publication than nonretracted papers even on curated platforms, such as news outlets and knowledge repositories. Interestingly, discussions on social media express more criticism toward subsequently retracted results and may thus contain early signals related to unreliable work."

  title: "Improving scientific publishing – Leading by example!"
  description: "The study of scientific publishing practices is a prominent topic in science of science. There is a rich body of work studying the journal publishing system, the organization of peer review, the use of impact factors and other citation metrics, the adoption of open access publishing and other open science practices, challenges around research integrity, the complex role of commercial publishers, and so on. The science of science community has a deep knowledge of many of the intricate issues related to scientific publishing. I will review some of this knowledge in my lecture. In addition, I will make a call for more reflection on our own publishing practices as science of science researchers: How do we, as members of the science of science community, disseminate our own research, and to what extent do we use our knowledge of the scientific publishing system to actively contribute to improving the system? I will argue that we need to do better: The science of science community has a responsibility to lead by example."

  description: "Data are needed to answer key questions about much of science: critical technologies, the transparency of AI, and programmatic efficiency.  Yet data are often not discoverable by the communities that need to access and use them.  This presentation provides a set of innovative new technologies to democratize the search for and discovery of data.  It provides new ways to (i) discover how scientific data are used from a broad cross-section of primary, secondary and even tertiary sources, (ii) validate the information with key stakeholders, and (iii) communicate the value of data. https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/g6e8noiy/release/2"

  title: "Augmenting Scientific Discovery By Harnessing Scientific Literature"
  description: "With over one million papers added every year to the PubMed biomedical index alone — the explosion of scholarly knowledge presents tremendous opportunities for accelerating research across the sciences. However, while scientific knowledge is expanding with rapidity, our human minds have limited capacity for finding, assimilating and manipulating information. In this talk, I will present our recent work toward helping researchers and practitioners make use of this vast treasure trove of information. I will highlight computational methods in artificial intelligence and natural language processing that mine literature and knowledge bases to help discover new directions and solutions to problems, generate hypotheses, make predictions and decisions, and build connections across different ideas and areas. This includes a method that predicts clinical outcomes of hospital patients by mining the literature for patient-specific medical literature, NLP-powered models for predicting off-label drug uses, and novel exploratory search and recommendation engines: for discovering drug combination therapies, causal relationships, challenges and directions in COVID-19 research, and authors who inspire novel directions and collaboration opportunities in the computer science community."

  title: "Causal Inference for Complex Observational Data"
  description: "The goal of most empirical studies in policy research and medical research is to determine whether an alteration in an intervention or a treatment will cause a change in the desired outcome response. Unlike randomized designs, establishing the causal relationship based on observational studies is a challenging problem because the ceteris paribus condition is violated. When the covariates of interest are measured with errors, evaluating the causal effects becomes a thorny issue. Additional challenge arises from confounding variables which are often of high dimensional or correlated with the error-prone covariates. Most of the existing methods for estimating the average causal effect heavily rely on parametric assumptions about the propensity score or the outcome regression model one way or the other. In reality, both models are prone to misspecification, which can have undue influence on the estimated average causal effect. To the best of our knowledge, all the existing methods cannot handle high-dimensional covariates in the presence of error-prone covariates. We propose a semiparametric method to establish the causal relationship, which yields a consistent estimator of the average causal effect. The method we proposed results in efficient estimators of the covariate effects. We investigate their theoretical properties and demonstrate their finite sample performance through extensive simulation studies."
