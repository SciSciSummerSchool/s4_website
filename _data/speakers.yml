  bio: "My group's research activities are broad and multidisciplinary, and we are active participants in the network science, complex systems, computational biology, and computational social science communities. Our work generally focuses on understanding the mechanisms by which large-scale patterns emerge from the collective actions of heterogeneous individuals and on developing novel techniques for inferring such patterns and mechanisms from rich data sources. Much of this work is methodological in nature, and we actively develop novel statistical and computational methods for automatically analyzing and modeling complex phenomena in biological, social and technological systems. All of these efforts draw heavily on data analysis, machine learning, statistics, probability, algorithms and graph theory. We are particularly interested in interactions between theory and data, and the development of rigorous methods for the study of complex systems."

More specifically, my research focuses on using machine learning and natural language processing techniques to improve information quality, organization and access, especially in the science and health domain. I am particularly interested in linguistic patterns that characterize people’s opinions, emotions, and language styles, and their roles in information representation and sharing in science literature, news and social media. My most recent work focuses on computational modeling of misinformation in science news. For example, I developed new methods for identifying exaggerated claims in science news by extracting and comparing claims from news articles and research papers. I also collaborate with social scientists to computationally operationalize social science theories and concepts to answer research questions in a variety of domains, such as political science, business, and mass communication. My work has been supported by funding sources including NSF, IMLS, and Microsoft."

She contributed extensively to network science (both mathematical modelling and empirical analysis) with applications in collaboration networks (e.g., GitHub), online social networks (e.g., Twitter, Facebook), communication networks, among others. The hallmark of her research is to integrate her background in economics with data science by blending traditional and novel data sources (e.g., social media) and methods (e.g., network analysis, machine learning) to ask how we can make data useful for people and communities. She is passionate about the development of a workforce using data science to contribute to community-based research. She was the co-director of UVA’s Data Science for the Public Good (DSPG) Young Scholars Program, and led the launch of the DSPG program in Turkey."
